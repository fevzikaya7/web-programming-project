                            Cedrus trees can grow up to 30–40 m (occasionally 60 m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood, thick ridged or square-cracked bark, and broad, level branches. The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots, which form the framework of the branches, and short shoots, which carry most of the leaves. The leaves are evergreen and needle-like, 8–60 mm long, arranged in an open spiral phyllotaxis on long shoots, and in dense spiral clusters of 15–45 together on short shoots; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from desiccation. The seed cones are barrel-shaped, 6–12 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in Abies, disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds. The seeds are 10–15 mm long, with a 20–30 mm wing; as in Abies, the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an unpleasant-tasting resin, thought to be a defence against squirrel predation. Cone maturation takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing the same time a year later. The pollen cones are slender ovoid, 3–8 cm long, produced in late summer, and shedding pollen in autumn.

                            Deciduous or evergreen shrubs and shrubs are woody plants that rarely become trees. The buds are covered with numerous scales arranged like tiles. The arrangement of leaves on the shoots is alternating. There are oil glands on the stems of flowers and leaves. The flowers are mostly terminal, ink clusters, and sometimes singly. The 5-piece bowl is free or fused to each other. Crown; bells, funnels or similar shapes. Etamines are 5-10. The ovary has 5-10 eyes. The fruit is an egg-shaped 8-10 mm long capsule. Seeds are very small and abundant. It shows the feature of being blown around by the wind.

                                <h5>Size</h5>Liquidambar styraciflua is a medium-sized to large tree, growing anywhere from 15–20 m (50–70 ft) in cultivation and up to 45 m (150 ft) in the wild, with a trunk up 60–90 cm (2–3 ft) in diameter, on average. Trees may live to 400 years. The tree is a symmetrical shape and crowns into an egg shape when the branches get too heavy after its first two years of cultivation.
                                <br><br>
                                <h5>Bark and branches</h5>Another distinctive feature of the tree is the peculiar appearance of its small branches and twigs. The bark attaches itself to these in plates edgewise instead of laterally, and a piece of the leafless branch with the aid of a little imagination readily takes on a reptilian form; indeed, the tree is sometimes called "alligatorwood". The bark is a light brown tinged with red and sometimes gray with dark streaks and has a density of 590 kg/m3 (37 lb/cu ft). It is deeply fissured with scaly ridges. The branches carry layers of cork. The branchlets are pithy, many-angled, winged, and at first covered with rusty hairs, finally becoming red brown, gray or dark brown. As an ornamental tree, the species has a drawback—the branches may have ridges or "wings" that cause more surface area, increasing weight of snow and ice accumulation on the tree. However, the wood is heavy and hard with an interlocking grain, but is difficult to season.
                                <br><br>
                                <h5>Flowers</h5>The flowers typically appear in spring and persist into autumn/fall, sometimes persisting into winter. They are typically about 25–40 mm  in diameter and are covered with rusty hairs. The flowers are unisexual and greenish in color. Staminate flowers in terminal racemes 5–8 cm (2–3 in) long, the pistillate in a solitary head on a slender peduncle borne in the axil of an upper leaf. Staminate flowers destitute of calyx and corolla, but are surrounded by hairy bracts. Stamens indefinite; filaments short; anthers introrse. Pistillate flowers with a two-celled, two-beaked ovary, the carpels produced into a long, recurved, persistent style. The ovaries all more or less cohere and harden in fruit. There are many ovules but few mature.

                                Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers, meaning that the trees are monoecious. The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on their species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid, which helps to guard from fungi and insects. The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.

                                The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut, inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal the white embryo.
                                <br><br><h5>Tree</h5>The almond is a deciduous tree, growing 4–10 m (13–33 ft) in height, with a trunk of up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. The young twigs are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The leaves are 8–13 cm (3–5 in) long, with a serrated margin and a 2.5 cm (1 in) petiole. The flowers are white to pale pink, 3–5 cm (1–2 in) diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring. Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30 °C (59 and 86 °F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of 200 to 700 hours below 7.2 °C (45.0 °F) to break dormancy. Almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7–8 months after flowering.

                            The common hackberry is easily distinguished from elms and some other hackberries by its cork-like bark with wart-like protuberances. The leaves are distinctly asymmetrical and coarse-textured. It produces small fruits that turn orange-red to dark purple in the autumn, often staying on the trees for several months. The common hackberry is easily confused with the sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) and is most easily distinguished by range and habitat. The common hackberry also has wider leaves that are coarser above than the sugarberry.
                            <br>The common hackberry is a medium-sized tree, 9 to 15 metres (30 to 50 ft) in height, with a slender trunk. In the best conditions in the southern Mississippi Valley area, it can grow to 40 metres (130 ft). It has a handsome round-topped head and pendulous branches. It prefers rich moist soil, but will grow on gravelly or rocky hillsides. The roots are fibrous and it grows rapidly. In the western part of its range, trees may still grow up to 29 m (95 ft). The maximum age attained by hackberry is probably between 150 and 200 years in ideal conditions.
                            The bark is light brown or silvery gray, broken on the surface into thick appressed scales and sometimes roughened with excrescences; the pattern is very distinctive. The remarkable bark pattern is even more pronounced in younger trees, with the irregularly-spaced ridges resembling long geologic palisades of sedimentary rock formations when viewed edge-wise. Coins as large as USA quarters can easily be laid flat against the valleys, which may be as deep as an adult human finger.

                            Willows all have abundant watery bark sap, which is heavily charged with salicylic acid, soft, usually pliant, tough wood, slender branches, and large, fibrous, often stoloniferous roots. The roots are remarkable for their toughness, size, and tenacity to live, and roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant.
                            <br><br><h5>Leaves</h5>The leaves are typically elongated, but may also be round to oval, frequently with serrated edges. Most species are deciduous; semievergreen willows with coriaceous leaves are rare, e.g. Salix micans and S. australior in the eastern Mediterranean. All the buds are lateral; no absolutely terminal bud is ever formed. The buds are covered by a single scale. Usually, the bud scale is fused into a cap-like shape, but in some species it wraps around and the edges overlap. The leaves are simple, feather-veined, and typically linear-lanceolate. Usually they are serrate, rounded at base, acute or acuminate. The leaf petioles are short, the stipules often very conspicuous, resembling tiny, round leaves, and sometimes remaining for half the summer. On some species, however, they are small, inconspicuous, and caducous (soon falling). In color, the leaves show a great variety of greens, ranging from yellowish to bluish color. Willows are among the earliest woody plants to leaf out in spring and the last to drop their leaves in autumn. Leafout may occur as early as February depending on the climate and is stimulated by air temperature. If daytime highs reach 10 °C (50 °F) for a few consecutive days, a willow will attempt to put out leaves and flowers.
                            <br><br><h5>Flowers</h5>With the exception of Salix martiana, willows are dioecious, with male and female flowers appearing as catkins on separate plants; the catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves. The staminate (male) flowers are without either calyx with corolla; they consist simply of stamens, varying in number from two to 10, accompanied by a nectariferous gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is itself borne on the rachis of a drooping raceme called a catkin, or ament. This scale is square, entire, and very hairy. The anthers are rose-colored in the bud, but orange or purple after the flower opens; they are two-celled and the cells open latitudinally. The filaments are threadlike, usually pale brown, and often bald.

                            It is a type of fruitless cherry tree and is known to grow up to 8-10 meters. Although the tree does not bear fruit, it has special flowers. It has flowers that slowly bloom creating a fairy-tale world. One of its distinctive features is that the flowers bloom slowly, but they fall out all of a sudden. This tree with special flowers is considered sacred in Japanese culture and has special meanings.
                            <br><br><h5>Importance of Sakura Tree in Japanese Culture</h5>
                            Sakura tree flowers, which are considered sacred to the Japanese, represent the beginning of life and spring with the slowly opening. These slow-blooming flowers fall out in an instant. Fresh and lively flowers fall before they fade. This situation shows that death can come at any time while life continues. Especially for the Japanese people, who have a great place in their culture of Samurai life, the Sakura tree reminds that life exists in its sudden death along with its beauty. The fact that these magnificently beautiful flowers stay on the branch for a short time and fall out while they are fresh and not wilted also symbolizes how short life is. It is celebrated with festivals lasting two weeks in 11 different cities, provided that the Sakura tree, which is considered sacred in Japan, begins to bloom.

                            Lemon Citrus lemon is a small evergreen tree in the family Rutaceae, a flowering plant native primarily to Northeast India, South Asia. The ellipsoidal yellow fruit of the tree is used worldwide for culinary and non-culinary purposes, especially for juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. Its pulp and peel are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid and has a pH of 2.2 and therefore has a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it an important ingredient in beverages and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pies. Grown in temperate climates and carrying essential oils, lemon fruits are widely produced in regions such as India, South America, Southeast Asia, California, the Aegean, and the Mediterranean. The fruit is primarily used for its juice, while the flesh and skin can be used in cooking and baking.

                            All citrus trees belong to the single genus Citrus and remain almost entirely interfertile. This includes grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and various other types and hybrids. As the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, citrus taxonomy is fairly controversial, confusing or inconsistent. The fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium, a kind of modified berry; it is covered by a rind originated by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall. Different names have been given to the many varieties of the species. Orange applies primarily to the sweet orange – Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. The orange tree is an evergreen, flowering tree, with an average height of 9 to 10 m (30 to 33 ft), although some very old specimens can reach 15 m (49 ft). Its oval leaves, alternately arranged, are 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in) long and have crenulate margins. Sweet oranges grow in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue, the white, bitter mesocarp or albedo (pith). The orange contains a number of distinct carpels (segments) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by a membrane, and containing many juice-filled vesicles and usually a few seeds (pips). When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non-climacteric. The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges. Other citrus groups also known as oranges are:
                            <br><br><b>Mandarin orange</b> (Citrus reticulata) is an original species of citrus, and is a progenitor of the common orange. 
                            <br><br><b>Bitter orange</b> (Citrus aurantium), also known as Seville orange, sour orange (especially when used as rootstock for a sweet orange tree), bigarade orange and marmalade orange. Like the sweet orange, it is a pomelo x mandarin hybrid, but arose from a distinct hybridization event. 
                            <br><br><b>Bergamot orange</b> (Citrus bergamia Risso), grown mainly in Italy for its peel, producing a primary essence for perfumes, also used to flavor Earl Grey tea. It is a hybrid of bitter orange x lemon. 
                            <br><br><b>Trifoliate orange</b> (Poncirus trifoliata), sometimes included in the genus (classified as Citrus trifoliata). It often serves as a rootstock for sweet orange trees and other Citrus cultivars.
                            <br><br>An enormous number of cultivars have, like the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.
                            <br>Orange trees generally are grafted. The bottom of the tree, including the roots and trunk, is called rootstock, while the fruit-bearing top has two different names: budwood (when referring to the process of grafting) and scion (when mentioning the variety of orange).

                                Olive tree Olea europaea is an evergreen tree or shrub with densely branched, broad-topped, evergreen leaves, native to the Mediterranean, Europe, Asia and Africa. The tree is stunted and rarely exceeds 8-15 m (26-49 ft) in height. 'Pisciottana', a unique species of 40,000 trees found only in the region around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy, often surpasses this with correspondingly large trunk diameters. It has a broad, curved, tuberous body. As the tree ages, the smooth gray bark of the trunk gradually cracks. The crown (top) of the tree expands each year, approximately as much as it increases in height. The tree is long-lived and can live for about 2000 years. The crown of the tree is open and asymmetrical in fertile soils, and more dense and rounded in unproductive soils. Its shoots are gray, thornless and almost triangular. Its silvery green leaves are oblong, with a leaf length of 20–86 mm and a width of 5–30 mm, depending on the type. Its lanceolate, very short-stalked, leathery-hard leaves are arranged in pairs opposite to the shoots. The leaves are simple, whole-edged, and the margins are slightly curved towards the underside. There is a pointed protrusion at the ends of the leaves. The upper surface of the leaf is dark gray-green and hairless, the lower surface is bluish-silver and covered with white dense silky hairs. Ten-slit calyx and crown, two stamens and bifid stigma, and small, white, hairy flowers in inflorescences that sprout from the axils of leaves and usually emerge from the previous year's tree branch. Inside the fleshy fruit of "Olea europaea" there is a hard core called "stone". Its fruit is small, 1–2.5 cm long, thin-fleshed, and wild ones are smaller than olive garden varieties. Olives are picked as their color changes from green to purple. Canned black olives can be artificially darkened (see below for processing) and may contain the chemical iron gluconate to improve appearance. Towards the end of spring, it has small whitish-yellow, fragrant flowers that open in sparse clusters in the armpits of the leaves. Flowers fertilized with pollen carried by the winds turn into fleshy and oily fruits. The fruit is green at first and becomes glossy black after ripening. The olive tree is a very valuable tree in terms of the "oil" obtained from the pulp and seed of the fruit. The tree has a very imposing and aesthetic appearance. Its wood is extremely resistant to decay. The olive tree grows in regions with an average annual temperature of 15-20 °C.
